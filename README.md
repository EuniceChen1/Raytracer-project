# Raytracer-project #

##Overview of the project:##
Project investigated the design of an optical ray tracer and was used to study different optical systems. This is a computational project and it was coded in Python.

##Work completed:##
1) Simulation of a refracted beam through a spherical refracting surface and two different orientations of a plano-convex lens

2) Analysed the relationship between RMS value and beam diameter

3) Investigated the diffraction limit of a lens
